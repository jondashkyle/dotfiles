# dotfiles

there are many dotfiles, but these are mine. very basic, and meant to be.

## install

run `bootstrap`, but clearly put some thought into this first, as it will overwrite your existing dotfiles.

## vim

- *nerdtree* for a directory tree
- *ctrlp* for fuzzy file/buffer search

### notes

planning to add some notes on vim here
